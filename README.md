# SAYNA-HTMLCSS-BATMAN1

This is my first html-css project for Sayna (called projet fil rouge).

The website is a cool project presenting the film "The Batman" with Robert Pattison as the Dark Knight.

Here are the trailer, the actors in the film, a form contact

## MY-TO-DO-LIST

(last update: Saturday, May 11, 2023)

-   **The responsive**: I coded this website on a laptop (16.9"),
-   **The form** is not really as expected in the figma file (css to improve)
